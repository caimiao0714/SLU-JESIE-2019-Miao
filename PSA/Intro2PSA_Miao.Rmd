Public Service Announcement
===

Definition of PSA
---
> Public Service Announcement (PSA) is a message in the public interest disseminated **without charge**, with the objective of **raising awareness of**, and **changing public attitudes and behavior** towards, **a social issue**.  
  
&nbsp;

> \hfill -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_announcement)


A less textbook-alike definition
---

- A free "commercial"/advertisement

- To change public attitudes

- On a social issue


How to implement a PSA
===

Goal
---

- Start with a **goal**: what do you want to accomplish?

- You goal should not just focus on a specific action. PSA should **motivate** the target audience to **take action**.

- Examples:
  a. To stop smoking
  b. To avoid using drugs
  c. To stop drunk driving
  d. To classify trash


Target audience
---

Characteristics of the audience:

1. Age
2. Gender
3. Occupation
4. ...

Your PSA should contain information relevant to the characteristics of your target audience.


Language
---

> Our quality merchandise and competitive prices ...


Language
---

> ~~Our quality merchandise and competitive prices ...~~


- Don't use this language style in your PSA!

- Use everyday language:
  a. ~~Fake news!~~
  b. Make America great again!
  c. Yes we can!
  
  
Emotion
---

- Emotions sell, facts do not. (Humans are not rational).

- Do not use an overwhelming amount of facts.

- Examples:
  + Tonight, many of children in Nigeria children will to bed hungery. Unless you help!
  + what happens here stays here!
  + A diamond is forever

Deliver ONE core message
---

- Core message: ONE thing you want the audience to hear.

- The most common PSA mistake: trying to get the audience to take more than one action.

- Stick with one message and deliver it with clarity.
